Hello! My name is Deidre Crous, and I am a student in Dr. Downing’s Software Engineering class. These next couple of weeks I will document my experiences in this class and my thoughts on the subject matter. 

## What did you do this past week?

This first week we were given an overview of what the semester will look like. My favorite part about that is that a lot of the technologies that we will be using are things that I have been wanting to learn in my spare time but have not had time to because of school, especially Angular JS and unit testing. In class we took a look at what assertions are useful for and why unit testing can be a better alternative in certain situations. I got called on in class and said that ten is odd. That was the only part of class I didn’t like.

## What's in your way?

So far, not much is in my way. I still have to purchase my textbooks which may present a challenge because there are a lot of them. 

## What will you do next week?

Next week (and later today) I will have to start reading the many chapters of reading assigned to us.I think keeping up with the readings will likely be the most difficult part of the course. I also need to get some other things going - install Docker and pull down the class Docker image, set up my Github Education Account and organize my class materials.
