## What did you do this past week?
Last week our first project (Collatz) was due on Thursday. I worked frantically to finish up my project and quickly learned that though the coding portion of the project was fairly simple, getting used to the development environment took a considerable amount of time. I spent about 10 hours trying to resolve some problems I was having with the makefile / test files and only an hour and a half writing an acceptable solution for Sphere.

## What's in your way?
My other classes are now starting to pick up, and I also have other commitments for the extracurriculars I am involved in. I need to start doing a better job of preparing for the quizzes.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I want to start reviewing the information we learned the previous class period before I go to class. Hopefully this will improve my quiz grades and prepare me for tests in the future. I also plan to start working on Project 2 with my partner tomorrow because I donâ€™t want to be in the same time crunch that I was in while working on Collatz.

### Tip of the Week
Start the projects early!!!
