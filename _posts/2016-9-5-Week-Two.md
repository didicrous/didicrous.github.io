## What did you do this past week?
Last week I was concerned about getting my textbooks, but it turned out to be fairly easy! The Co-Op had an affordable copy of the Javascript book and I found copies of the other two books online to use while I wait for the hard copies I ordered via Amazon. With that said, I was able to do the reading for Extreme Programming and I learned about a pretty neat development process. In class we looked at some ways to optimize our Collatz project and the work flow of our project. What we did in class and the reading reinforced the importance of frequent and continual testing. In order to start working on the Collatz project, I downloaded Docker, set up my github repositories and became familiar with the development environment Professor Downing requires.

## What's in your way?
It usually takes me a week or two to acclimate when the new semester kicks in, and the first projects / readings take me a bit longer than expected because I’m still trying to figure out what my professors are expecting.

## What will you do next week?
This next week I will do the rest of the reading in the Extreme Programming  textbook and (hopefully) I will finish up with Collaz by Wednesday! I also want to dig into the Javascript readings.  

### Tip of the Week
Do the reading before the first class day of the week. The quizzes often have questions from the reading and you won’t be able to guess your way through it!
